4. Ballad (different verse from final, pitched voice in transition)
5. Routine (different vocal effects)
6. How High (beat tweaked and slightly shifted, different transition)
7. Romeo Must Die (way louder and frequent 808, more reverb, different transition)
8. Racer (louder ad-libs)
9. BeBe's Kids (different beat with a guitar lead)
10. Stereotypes
